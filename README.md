# Stardew Valley Hold to Process Geodes

A Stardew Valley [SMAPI](https://smapi.io) mod that repeatedly processes
geodes while the left mouse button is held down.

You can find this mod on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/26189)
if you prefer.

Use by itself or combine with [Fast Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1089) for
super-speedy geode cracking!

Inspired by [Hold to Break Geodes](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1689), which
is [no longer maintained](https://danvolchek.com/projects/stardew-valley-mods/#the-end-of-an-era)
and does not have an open source license.  If it did I would have forked it instead of doing a
from-scratch rewrite.
